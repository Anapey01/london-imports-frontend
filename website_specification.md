# Preorder-First Website Specification

A **commitment-based commerce platform** — not "an online shop."

Core message: *"We collect real demand, secure real supply, and deliver predictably."*

---

## Homepage Structure

### Above the Fold (< 5 seconds to convert)

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Headline** | "Reserve Before Stock Arrives. Pay Securely. Receive on Schedule." |
| **Sub-statement** | Plain-language preorder explanation |
| **Primary CTA** | "View Upcoming Drops" or "Reserve Now" |
| **Trust anchor** | Fulfilled orders count / "Trusted by X customers" |

**Do NOT:**
- Overload with categories
- Lead with discounts
- Hide preorder logic

### Proof of Results (Below fold)

Display real metrics:
- Total preorders fulfilled
- Current active preorders
- Delivery accuracy: *"92% delivered within promised window"*

---

## Product Discovery

### Product Cards (Required Fields)

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Product image | Visual |
| Product name | Identification |
| **Preorder badge** | "Preorder – Arrives in 3–4 weeks" |
| Price | With deposit logic if applicable |
| **Demand signal** | "312 reserved" |

### Category Structure

Group by **delivery logic**, not just type:
- Upcoming Gadgets
- Fashion Preorders
- Ready-to-Ship (small)
- Closing Soon (cutoff approaching)

---

## Product Detail Page

### A. Preorder Summary Box (Sticky)

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Status | Preorder |
| Delivery window | 3–4 weeks (range, not date) |
| Payment structure | Full / Deposit + Balance |
| Cutoff date | May 12 |
| Fulfillment | Delivery / Pickup |

**Must never scroll out of view on desktop.**

### B. Timeline / Milestone Section

```
Orders collected    → Closes May 12
Supplier confirmed  → May 14
In transit          → May 20–June 2
Local dispatch      → June 3–5
```

Removes anxiety without over-promising.

### C. "Why Preorder?" Section

Explain:
- Why this item is preorder
- What customer gains (price, availability, certainty)
- Risks and how they're handled

*Transparency converts better than persuasion.*

### D. Social Proof (Only provable)

- Number of reservations
- Verified customer comments
- Past delivery photos

**Do not fabricate urgency.**

---

## Checkout Experience

### Principles

- Fewer steps than normal ecommerce
- Clear restatement of:
  - Delivery window
  - Refund rules
  - Payment terms

### Payment Display

| Show | Example |
|------|---------|
| Amount charged now | GHS 150.00 |
| Amount charged later | GHS 350.00 (on dispatch) |
| Refund conditions | Full refund if cancelled before cutoff |

**Payment methods:**
- Mobile Money (mandatory)
- Card payments
- Deposit-only option

---

## Post-Order Experience

### Order Confirmation Page

Not a receipt — a **status dashboard**:
- Order ID
- Product summary
- Current stage
- Next update date
- Support contact (visible, human)

### Ongoing Updates

Updates must be:
- Scheduled
- Predictable
- Honest

*Silence destroys trust faster than delay.*

---

## Trust & Policy Pages

Footer + checkout links:
- How Preorders Work
- Delivery Windows Explained
- Refund & Cancellation Policy
- Vendor & Supply Model

---

## Design Language

### Visual Tone

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Calm | Flash sales language |
| Structured | Over-animation |
| Professional | "Hurry!" without data |

*Preorder buyers value certainty, not excitement.*

### Mobile First (Non-Negotiable)

- Thumb-friendly CTAs
- Persistent preorder summary
- Lightweight pages
- WhatsApp integration (support only)

---

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ Jumia clone
- ❌ WhatsApp catalogue replacement
- ❌ Dropshipping storefront
- ❌ Hype-only launch page

**✅ Demand-validation + fulfillment-execution platform**
