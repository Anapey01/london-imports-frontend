# What to Avoid - Anti-Patterns Reference

> *"Do not promise what you cannot predict. Do not hide what you cannot control. Do not automate what requires judgment."*

---

## Strategic Errors

| Avoid | Why | Do Instead |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Preorder as "feature add-on" | Users assume instant delivery | Make preorder the core logic |
| Speed promises | Missed dates destroy trust | Sell delivery windows, not days |
| Jumia-style UX | Encourages browsing, not commitment | Reduce choice anxiety |

## Trust & Communication

| Avoid | Why | Do Instead |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Silence after payment | Interpreted as fraud | Scheduled, predictable updates |
| Vague language ("soon", "processing") | Cannot model progress | Map status to real operations |
| Hidden human support | Uncertainty needs humans | Visible WhatsApp/phone access |

## Payment & Policy

| Avoid | Why | Do Instead |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Full prepay without protection | Customers fear total loss | Explicit refund conditions |
| One-size-fits-all payments | Fashion ≠ Gadgets | Category-specific logic |
| Overly generous refund promises | Supply already committed | Rule-based, not emotional |

## Product & Inventory

| Avoid | Why | Do Instead |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Listing without supply confidence | High cancellations | Validate supply first |
| Mixing in-stock + preorder | Wrong expectations | Clear separation always |

## UX & Design

| Avoid | Why | Do Instead |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Overdesign/gimmicks | Preorder buyers are risk-aware | Calm, structured design |
| Complex dashboards | Information overload | Show only predictive info |
| Fake urgency | Erodes trust | Real cutoffs only |

## Growth & Operations

| Avoid | Why | Do Instead |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Hiding results | No social proof | Show fulfillment history |
| Optimizing for one-time buyers | Low lifetime value | Retention first |
| Over-automation | Edge cases overwhelm | Automate workflows, not judgment |
| Launching without internal discipline | Small delays = public failures | Internal certainty first |
