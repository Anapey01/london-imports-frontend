# Platform Principles

**Not replacing incompetence. Industrializing proven behavior.**

---

## 1. Human Confirmation — Automate Around It

Do not remove WhatsApp or calls. Enhance them.

| Action | System Support |
|--------|----------------|
| Order summary | Auto-generate |
| Confirmations | Time-stamp |
| Conversations | Attach tracking IDs |

---

## 2. Visibility, Not Control

Existing platforms minimize promises because delays are real.

**Do:**
- Use delivery windows: *"Week of May 20–27"*
- Show milestone statuses
- Avoid fake precision

**Don't:**
- Promise exact dates
- Hide delays

---

## 3. Formalized Trust Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Receipt-based preorder contracts | Legal clarity |
| Partial deposits (fashion) | Lower commitment barrier |
| Clear refund triggers | Remove ambiguity |

---

## 4. Pre-Payment as Risk Management

Pre-payment is not greed — it's risk management.

**Enhancements:**
- Split into deposit + balance
- Hold funds in escrow until arrival
- Publish fulfillment history metrics

---

## 5. Design for Repeat Buyers

Existing platforms survive on repeat customers.

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Pre-order history | Easy reorder |
| Loyalty pricing | Retention |
| Early access | Reward trust |

## What "Better" Means

| Not | But |
|-----|-----|
| Louder | Predictable |
| More complex | Transparent |
| Replacing humans | Human-aware |
| Generic | Locally grounded |
| Manual | System-supported |
