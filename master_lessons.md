## I. Foundational Lessons

### 1. Preorder Is a Business Model, Not a Feature
Validates demand → Protects capital → Controls inventory → Manages delivery risk

Clear timelines > Fast delivery

### 3. Local Context Shapes Global Patterns
Ghanaian platforms: rational, risk-aware, trust-driven, human-mediated

## II. Demand & Sales Lessons

### 4. Measurable Demand Converts Better Than Features
Show: reservation counts, fulfillment progress, delivery accuracy

### 5. Preorder Sells Commitment, Not Browsing
Filter casual shoppers via: cutoffs, deposits, explicit labeling

### 6. Transparency > Discounts
Clear delivery windows + refund conditions outperform price incentives

## III. Product & Inventory Lessons

### 7. Inventory Follows Demand, Not Guesswork
Stock ordered after commitments → minimized risk, stabilized cash flow

Clear milestones > "fast delivery" claims

Deposit + balance: reduces friction, maintains protection

### 12. Escrow-Like Logic Builds Confidence
Milestone payments + clear refund triggers → trust + repeat usage

Label clearly → Separate from in-stock → Design around time

1. What am I reserving?
2. When will I receive it?
3. What if things change?

### 15. Timelines Beat Exact Dates
Ranges reduce disputes, match real logistics

### 16. Post-Order Experience = Part of the Sale
Order dashboards + predictable updates + human access

Publish: preorder numbers, milestones, past success

Design rewards returning customers, not just first-time curiosity

Competing on: predictability, transparency, execution reliability
